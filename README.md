# 2012 Workplace Fatalities, Injuries, and Illness.

**Author:** Mathew Stanfield

**Institution:** QuickStart

**Project Date:** 4/22/2024 â€“ 5/5/2024


## Summary

In this project, I aim to provide a comparative analysis of all State and Federal workplace related fatalities, injuries, and illnesses. I have visualized the data into charts that break down the information by which program they occurred in, state or federal, the density of incidents, and by which geographical state the incidents occurred in.

## Business Problem

My client proposed the question of which program, state or federal, had the most fatalities and which geographical states these incidents occurred in during the year 2012. Furthermore, the client requested a visual representation of the correlation, if any, between the fatality rate and the time between inspections of the various facilities.

## Data

The data that was used in this project included a total count of fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and the monthly rate at which these incidents occurred. The data also shows which program, state or federal, and which geographical state the incidents occurred in. 

## Methods

In this data set I used various graphs, including line, bar, and maps, as well as two separate pivot tables to visualize the data that was pertinent to the project. I utilized slicers on both pivot tables to enable viewers to cut into the data and extract meaningful insights. To establish the correlation between the period between inspections and the fatality rate, I utilized a scatter plot for the two data sets which shows the values and compare them to the average value.

## Results

The results show that the total number of fatalities that occurred in both state and federal programs in 2012 was 4,617. The state with the largest fatality rate was Texas, having a federal program and 536 fatalities. The state with the lowest fatality rate was Rhode Island, also having a federal program and only 8 fatalities. The data also shows that there is no correlation between the years between inspection of facilities and the fatality rate.

## Conclusions

If I had more time and adequate data, I would have liked to break down the causes of the injuries and fatalities in the workplace. This data could help show where efforts need to be allocated to avoid future incidents.
